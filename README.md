# Keyboard-keystroke-dynamics
A program for capturing data on the dynamics of keystrokes on the keyboard. The program is developed in the Java language.

The program records the time intervals of the keys of the English alphabet, periods, commas and spaces. It also records the average time each key is held and the number of keys pressed. In addition, it records the number of errors (presses on the backspace) and the total time of rewriting the text.
